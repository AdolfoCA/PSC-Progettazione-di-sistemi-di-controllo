# PSC - Control System Design
The work carried out involved the mathematical modeling and simulation of a simple pendulum and an inverted pendulum using Matlab/Simulink tools. Subsequently, a control system was designed to stabilize the M5stack Bala-C robot, using techniques learned during the course. The work is divided into three phases: the first consists of modeling the simple pendulum and the inverted pendulum with a cart, followed by the graphical simulation of the pendulums' evolution using Matlab; the second focuses on synthesizing the control of the pendulums using classical techniques, followed by graphical simulation with Matlab/Simulink; the third involves the implementation of the actual controller to ensure the stability of the Bala-C robot.
